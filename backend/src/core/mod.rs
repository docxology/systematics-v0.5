//! Core types for the Systematics property graph.
//!
//! This module provides the fundamental building blocks:
//! - `Language` - Semantic vocabularies and representation types
//! - `entries` - Entry types (Character, Term, Coordinate, Colour, etc.) and the Entry enum
//! - `links` - Link types (Line, Connective)
//! - `graph` - Graph structure with query methods
